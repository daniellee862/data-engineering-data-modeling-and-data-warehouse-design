# Top Model

## Learning Objectives

-   To be able to refactor a table to 1NF, 2NF and 3NF
-   To be able to implement a star schema
-   To be able to implement an ERD

Congratulations! You've been hired by the Northcoders Modelling Agency! ðŸ’…
All of the data we have on our models are currently being held in one big SQL table which you can create locally by running `models.sql`.

---

## Our first task is to normalise the data **without mutating** our original data:

-   Create new files for each of your Normal Forms
-   Remember that you can print the output of the file to a new file with the command below:

```
psql -f file_name.sql > file_name.txt
```

## Part I - OLTP

---

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF)

The rules we can follow are:

-   We must have no duplicate rows
-   Each cell must only contain a single value
-   Each value cannot be split down further

Print the result to a txt file called `1NF.txt`

### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)

We will then need to refactor to 2NF:

-   Table must not violate the rules set out by 1NF
-   No partial dependencies - Non-prime attributes must be fully dependant on the candidate key.

Print the result to a txt file called `2NF.txt`

<br>

### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)

Lastly refactor to 3NF:

-   Table must not violate the rules set out by 2NF
-   No transitive dependencies - fields must be determined by the primary / composite key

Print the result to a txt file called `3NF.txt`

### 4. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An `ERD` is a helpful visual representation of how relational tables fit together in a database.
Use the following free software to build an ERD to document the database in it's three forms.

## Part II - OLAP

### 1. Building a star schema

We want to make our database easier and more efficient to analyse.
We should redesign the database into a star schema.

Things to consider:

-   **dimensions** - what can we extract? What metrics will these allow us to measure?
-   **facts** - what does this table look like? How can do we create the link to dimensions.

## 2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Create another ERD to represent how our tables now link together.
